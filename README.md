# Mass File Renamer-inator

Felicitations! This tool is made for those who want to alter multiple filenames of the same filetype (truly needed when handling thousands of files). It is pretty straight to the point, and when running the program it will walk you through usage and possibilities.

Will of course require Python, and an Operating System.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you have a grand day/night!
